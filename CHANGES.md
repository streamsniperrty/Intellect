### What I worked on
- Edited the CSS pages and any component styling to fit the standards designed by Addrita.
- Bottom half of background page is green, consistent with the design of rest of the pages.

### What needs to be improved
- When adding items in the boxes, the bottom three elements moves along with the content of the box. So, this means the buttons and typing area are prone to leaving the main box. This needs to be fixed.
- The size of the starts interferes with the buttons, meaning the user has to go to the very top edge of the button in order to click.
- The buttons need to be styled properly.

### Goals for next time
- Button styling
